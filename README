# VHDL Sandbox

Welcome to my VHDL Sandbox where I shitpost my irrelevant VHDL experiments.
Each directory within this repository hosts one or more VHDL components, along
with a test bench to simulate the components.

## Goals

The goal is simple and selfish at its finest, to teach myself some VHDL.
But as the saying goes: `One man's trash is another man's treasure`, my
server stoarge wasting shitposting may be useful to someone out there.

## Dependencies

To test any of the components provided in this repository, the following software is required:

- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/)
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)

For Ubuntu systems, these dependencies can be installed as it follows:

```
$ sudo apt install build-essential ghdl gtkwave
```

## Simulating

To simulate a component, enter the directory and simply execute `make`. Once the VHDL code has been analyzed, 
processed and executed with GHDL, the runtime of the testbench can be viewed in gtkwave by running `make gtkwave`.
